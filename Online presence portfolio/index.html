            <h3>Silos renovation</h3>
            <p>Renovation of Silos is an unfinnished project of mine. The idea behind this is to make one of the biggest building in my hoetown more beautiful. It is also the first thing noticed when approching the town from the sea. It would look more fun and attractive if there was more life to it rather than it being simply grey. For this project to actually work it would require a lot of work, organisation, and even permision to do something like that. </p>
